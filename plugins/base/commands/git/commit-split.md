**IMPORTANT**: Invoke the `split-commit` skill before proceeding.

# Commit Split

Split large changes into logical commits organized by semantic meaning.

When working on large features or refactors, this workflow helps organize changes into focused, meaningful commits:

1. Invoke `split-commit` skill
2. Follow the interactive workflow to identify semantic groups
3. Create commits for each logical unit
4. Create commit using heredoc format for proper multi-line handling
